<p>BACKGROUND:I was born in <strong>Kiambu County, Kenya</strong>. I am the second born out of five children. I was raised in Uganda,Kampala when my parents relocated their for work. Right after thier contract was over we moved back to Kenya.I have been blessed with two amazing brothers and two sisters who teach me nothing but humility. Having brothers has enabled me keep abreast in all aspects of technology. Being the second born and the first girl in the family has come with alot of responsibilities and challenges which among them includes showing a good example to my siblings and also maintaining a good relationship with my brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>EDUCATION: I finished my Kenya School of Primary Education and later went back to do my O'Level and A'Level Education in Uganda. Once i finished my studies i relocated back to Kenya to pursue my passion in the legal profession. I successfully Graduated with my Bachelor in Law Degree in 2014 and later qualified as an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya from the Kenya School of law. Apart from my Law degree i have armed myself in other professional courses that include;
             <ul>
